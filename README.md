# What is this?
This is a UI component library for Svelte that i use in my personal projects or my friends use it. <br />
This is never stable, and can change a lot any time. <br />
This is has been made fully in Svelte from scratch, doesn't port anything.

# Install
Just download the thing and throw it in your project.<br/>
Or use git submodules.<br/>
Or use other solutions idk, I'm not adding this to npm.
