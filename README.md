# What is this?

This is a UI component library for Svelte that i use in my personal projects or my friends use it. <br />
This is never stable, and can change a lot any time. <br />
This is has been made fully in Svelte from scratch, doesn't port anything.

# Install

## Add it as submodule

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/DeepDoge/kicho-ui.git ./src/lib/kicho-ui
```

You can run these post install

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Manually

Just download the thing and throw it in your project.<br/>
Or use other solutions idk, I'm not adding this to npm.
